# Ayu  
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rahmanda/ayu.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rahmanda/ayu)

Ayu is yet another CSS bootstrap for web UI. It is built over simplicity, flexibility, and reusability in mind. The minimized file size is only 42kb, but you can build tons of UI you want without making your asset fat.

## Components  
Ayu consists of components below:  
- Badges  
- Buttons  
- Fields  
- Box  
- Callout  
- Modal  
- Grid (via Gridle)  
They are very lite and highly reusable. Even so, you can build new UI by combining two or more components.

## Styleguide  
For the sake of clarity and consistency, we embrace [BEM styleguide](http://getbem.com/introduction/). 

## Extending and Modifying  
It is very easy to extend because every unit can be easily overidden. Every extendable units are separated from component styling so you can easily adjust it however you like.  

## Icons  
We don't ship icons with this framework because we want to keep it lightweight and ensure that it can be use with any preferable icons you want. However, for the sake of giving you an idea on how you can use your icons, we included example icons on demo.  

## Documentation and Demo  
We don't have live documentation and demo at this moment. In the meantime, you can build it on your local machine by following guide below:  
1. Install [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) on your local machine.  
2. Clone this repo `git clone https://github.com/rahmanda/ayu`.  
3. Open terminal, go to repo directory, then run `npm install -g gulp-cli bower && npm install && bower install`.  
4. Run `gulp server`, then run `gulp` on separate terminal window. It will automatically open the demo page on your browser.
